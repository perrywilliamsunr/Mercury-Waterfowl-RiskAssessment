# Mercury Contamination in Wood Ducks

## Overview
This repository contains data, code, and results related to the research project on mercury contamination in wood ducks. The main objective of this project is to analyze the levels of mercury contamination and understand its environmental impacts.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `Code`: Contains all the code used for data analysis and modeling.
  - `MCMC_Algorithm`: Sub-folder containing the MCMC algorithm implementation.
    - `MCMC_Algorithm.R`: The main MCMC algorithm script.
    - `Example_Application.R`: Example script to demonstrate how to use the MCMC algorithm.

- `Data`: Includes datasets used for the research. (Detailed descriptions and formats can be found in a README file within this directory.)

- `Documentation`: Additional documentation related to the research project, including experimental design, analysis methods, and protocols.

- `R_Output`: Stores the output files generated by the R scripts, including MCMC results and other analysis outputs.

- `Results`: Summaries of data analysis, visualizations, tables, and figures generated during the research.

## Code Details
### MCMC Algorithm
The `MCMC_Algorithm` folder contains two key R scripts:

1. **MCMC_Algorithm.R**:
    - Implements the MCMC algorithm for analyzing mercury contamination.
    - Functions:
        - `run_mcmc`: Runs the MCMC sampling based on the provided data and parameters.
    - Parameters:
        - `y`: Response variable matrix.
        - `X`: Design matrix.
        - `n.iter`: Number of MCMC iterations.
        - `initial_values`: Initial values for the parameters.
        - `tuning_parameters`: Tuning parameters for the MCMC steps.
        - `prior_parameters`: Prior parameters for the distributions.
        - `file_name`: Base name for saving output files.
        - `save_dir`: Directory to save the output files.

2. **Example_Application.R**:
    - Demonstrates how to use the `run_mcmc` function with simulated data.
    - Example workflow:
        - Defines data and parameters.
        - Simulates data for demonstration purposes.
        - Runs the `run_mcmc` function.
        - Loads and visualizes the MCMC output.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Wood-Duck-Mercury-Contamination.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the `Code/MCMC_Algorithm` directory** and review the scripts.

3. **Run the Example Application**:
    - Open `Example_Application.R` in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
    - Ensure all necessary libraries are installed.
    - Source and run the script to see the MCMC algorithm in action.
